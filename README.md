# Goal: Setup SDL

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a powerful, cross-platform development library designed to simplify the process of creating windows. Once you've set up a window, you can then choose to render graphics within it using a built-in SDL renderer, or by integrating with more advanced graphics APIs like OpenGL or Vulkan. SDL handles the foundational tasks of input management (like keyboard and mouse events), window events (resizing, closing, etc.), and context management, freeing you to concentrate on the core logic of your application's rendering.
